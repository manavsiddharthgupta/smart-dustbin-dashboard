# Smart Dustbin Dashboard

The Smart Dustbin Dashboard is a project that provides real-time monitoring of the dustbin status. The system includes a physical dustbin with sensors that detect the waste level, which is wirelessly transmitted to the dashboard for display. The dashboard presents a graphical representation of the data, including the current fill level and a historical graph of fill levels over time. Users can configure alerts to be notified when the dustbin reaches a particular fill level and view data analytics on usage patterns.

# Technologies Used
- React.js and Chart.js
- Node.js and Express.js
- Firebase
- Twilio
- Integrated Map
- MQTT protocol

## Installation
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the repository:  ```git clone https://github.com/manavsiddharthgupta/smart-dustbin-dashboard.git```
3. Install the necessary dependencies ```npm install```.

This project utilizes a smart dustbin dashboard that provides real-time monitoring of the dustbin status. The system includes a physical dustbin with sensors that detect the waste level, which is wirelessly transmitted to the dashboard for display.

The dashboard presents a graphical representation of the data, including the current fill level and a historical graph of fill levels over time. Users can configure alerts to be notified when the dustbin reaches a particular fill level and view data analytics on usage patterns.

The project incorporates various tools and technologies, including an Arduino microcontroller for interfacing with sensors and transmitting data to the cloud, Firebase for the cloud backend, and React.js and Chart.js for the frontend. Additionally, the MQTT protocol is used for communication between Arduino and the cloud. Overall, this project offers an innovative waste management solution that can help optimize collection processes and reduce associated costs.
